This Dataset combines two datasets: the HYG combined bright star catalog, and a dataset which details the hex code for each stellar spectrum classification.\n\nI used these two datasets to assign a hex code value to every star in the database which had a spectrum classification.\n\nI was then able to manipulate the ggplot manual legend function to assign a color to each spectrum based on its hex code.\n\nThe resulting dataset displays the exact color of each star. The data is displayed in a way that shows each constellations spectral distribution.\n```{r}\nsource(\"../02 Data Wrangling/Workflow2.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```",
