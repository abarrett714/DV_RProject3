2.) This Dataset combines two datasets: the HYG combined bright star catalog, and a dataset which details the hex code for each stellar spectrum classification.

I used these two datasets to assign a hex code value to every star in the database which had a spectrum classification.

I was then able to manipulate the ggplot manual legend function to assign a color to each spectrum based on its hex code.

The resulting dataset displays the exact color of each star. The data is displayed in a way that shows each constellations spectral distribution.
